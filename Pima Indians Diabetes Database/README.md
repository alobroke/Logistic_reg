The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.



Although logistic regression provides a solid, interpretable baseline for diabetes prediction, its linear nature limits how well it can capture the complex, non-linear relationships among medical features like glucose, BMI, and insulin levels. As a result, its accuracy typically stabilizes around 70–75%. More advanced models such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, or **Neural Networks** can learn intricate interactions and non-linear decision boundaries, allowing them to achieve higher predictive performance (often 80–88% accuracy or higher). Therefore, while logistic regression is ideal for explainability and baseline comparison, **ensemble and deep learning models generally deliver better results** for this dataset.
